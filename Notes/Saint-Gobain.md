When Saint-Gobain once again became a private enterprise, control of the company quickly changed hands. [Jean-Louis Beffa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Beffa "Jean-Louis Beffa"), an engineer and graduate of the [École Polytechnique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique "École Polytechnique"), became the [CEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO "CEO"). Beffa invested heavily in [research and development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development "Research and development") and pushed strongly for the company to produce engineered materials, such as abrasives and [ceramics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic_materials "Ceramic materials").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Gobain#cite_note-18)

Under Beffa, the company continued to expand internationally, setting up foreign factories, and acquiring many of its foreign competitors. In 1996 the company bought [Poliet](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Poliet&action=edit&redlink=1 "Poliet (page does not exist)") (the French building and construction distribution group) and its subsidiaries, such as Point P. and Lapeyre. This expanded Saint-Gobain's product line into construction materials and their distribution. In 2005, [Olivier Bluche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercy "Commercy") took the helm of Supply Chain Operations, quickly modernising the company's lengthy and dated processes. In October 2022, Saint-Gobain Films & Fabrics was renamed Saint-Gobain Composite Solutions.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Gobain#cite_note-19) In 2023, the company's India-arm acquired Twiga Fiberglass, a manufacturer of glass wool with production facilities located near Delhi and Mumbai.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Gobain#cite_note-20)
